Getting Graylog to install in 1 click was not straight forward so I created it to make my life easy.
This script installs Graylog in a Kubernetes cluster.
The script would install MongoDB and Elasticsearch (dependencies) before deploying Graylog.
Parameters can be updated to adjust to a new environment/cluster.
